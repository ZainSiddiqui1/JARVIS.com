        <i><u><b><hr></b></u></i><p>
            "It's an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marvel and this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey [Jr.] will do a voice for that." Unless Marvel has had a massive change of heart, Downey Jr. will be back as Iron Man/Tony Stark for one last time.History
            Early Life
            Tony Stark was born a genius and one of the twin sons of industrialist inventor Howard Stark, with the other son being Gregory.[7] Despite Howard's determination to have Tony continue Stark Industries' legacy, Tony set out to create his own company from scratch so to leave his father's shadow, a promising small business called JT Technologies he was working on with his girlfriend Josey Gardner. Unfortunately, Howard continued pressuring Tony, and he managed to sway his son away from his dreams. Tony reluctantly joined Howard's side, and as a consequence, Josey left him.
            
            Six months later, Josey died tragically in a plane crash.[8] Unbeknownst to anybody, Josey's death had been orchestrated by Mandarin International, a company Howard dealt with during Stark Industries' fledgling days, but had cut ties with ever since. Josey's death had the effect the Mandarin desired on Tony,[9] as Howard convinced the boy to channel his emotions into his work and throw himself into his inventions. Tony's first project following Josey's death involved the development of cutting edge nanotechnology.[8]
            
            Becoming Iron Man
            Following Howard's death, presumably at the hands of the Mandarin in revenge for walking on them, Tony took full reins of Stark Industries.[9] As he grew up a cynic, alcoholic womanizer, Stark also became a world-wide celebrity and a brand name.[10] His company was the third biggest in America, and he was the world's third-richest man. However, Tony's life took a drastic change when he was was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.[11] Desperate for a cure, Tony met with the best oncologists from all over the world. While visiting a children's hospital, he met a young boy named Sam who was undergoing chemotherapy. Sam's death even after being treated for three years encouraged Tony to use the time he had left to put his resources to use for a better world.[12] Tony additionally turned to technology to help himself, and started devising a temporary cure in the form of a mixture of bio-tech and armor.
            
            During a business trip in Guatemala, Stark and his cousin Morgan were captured along with the passengers on their flight by a guerrilla militia called the Red Devil. The soldiers murdered Morgan when Tony refused to cooperate. Tony eventually agreed to help the terrorists, and built a rough exo-skeleton based on the preliminary designs of the armor he was working on in the States. However, without the necessary precautions, Stark made is so the device purposefully backfired on his captors, which facilitating his freedom[13] and allowed him to lead a rescue mission that saved the lives of his fellow captives. Stark's actions kick-started events that ended the Red Devil's reign of international terrorism. In the aftermath of this incident, Tony stayed away from the public spotlight for almost two years. When he returned, Tony refashioned himself as a superhero,[14] using his latest invention, a nanotechnology-operated suit to become the armor-clad super hero Iron Man.[15] Iron Man became a global phenomenon after he saved the Vice-President from an assassination attempt.[14]
            
            For a while, Tony operated together with his friend Jim Rhodes, who wore an armor similar to Tony's and went by the alias of War Machine. They had a falling out after Tony's recklessness almost cost both of their lives when fighting A.I.M. forces. The last time they had spoken, Rhodey berated Tony for his behavior, and Stark had him removed from his building by security.[16]
            
            Ultimates
            Continuing with his desire to help save the world, Stark accepted an offer to join the Ultimates, a S.H.I.E.L.D.-sponsored superhero team, as Iron Man.[15] Forming an unlikely friendship with anti-corporate teammate Thor, Stark helped subdue the monstrous Hulk and save Earth from the extraterrestrial Chitauri.[17]
            
            Tony began dating teammate Natasha Romanova and eventually proposed to her, creating a new armor for her as an engagement gift; however, when a traitor within the ranks helped an army of foreign Super-Soldiers defeat the Ultimates, Natasha was apparently revealed as the traitor when she turned on Tony during the assault, killing Tony's good friend, and butler, Jarvis. Tony turned the tables on her, using the nanites he had given Natasha to control the armor against his former lover, paralyzing her and downloading information direct from her brain to his.</p>

                Magneto, in response to the death of his children, shifted the Earth's axis, causing world-wide devastation. New York was demolished by a huge tidal wave, which also destroyed Tony's home, and killed millions, including some heroes, in the process (e.g. Wasp, Daredevil, etc.). Tony, who was saved by his suit, rescued Captain America, and the two went looking for survivors. Cap fell unconscious, and Tony was forced to bring Cap to the Triskelion, where Cap was met with immediate help. Magneto's goons, the Multiple Men, were causing havoc outside the Triskelion, each strapped with a bomb. Iron Man helped as much as he could to stop Madrox, but it was a suicidal for Hank Pym who killed them all, allowing all of them to crawl over his body, and then walk into the seas, waiting for the stupid Madroxs to blow themselves up, killing all of them, and Pym. Tony and the Ultimates traveled to Magneto's base, where Wolverine immediately attacked. Before Wolverine could kill Magneto, Magneto took control of Cyclops' lenses, and Iron Man's suit, forcing the two to blast Wolverine. Magneto then easily killed the melted hero. As Magneto was later killed, Tony was about to meet an all new adventure.
